Panic Button
============

Allows to use the "Big Red Button" from DreamCheeky on Linux.

By default it calls /usr/bin/button-handler.sh. 
That file should contain all the instructions that should run when the button is pressed.

Make sure to run the tool as root, because you need write-access to the device.
